*PyMine-Net - an extensible and modular Minecraft networking library in Python*

## Archivation

PyMine-net is no longer maintained, however, in it's place, a new project called [mcproto](https://github.com/py-mine/mcproto) was created, so if you're
here looking for a library that provides an easy way to work with the minecraft's protocol, feel free to check it out instead!

## Features
- Buffer class with methods for dealing with various types and data formats used by Minecraft
- High level abstractions for packets with a system to seperate different protocol's packets
- Miscellaneous classes for dealing with different Minecraft data structures relevant to networking
